# HiI'm

> **Stop Talking. Start Walking.**
> The first dating app that requires physical connection to unlock the destination.

 

## 📖 About The Project

**HiI'm** is a mobile dating application designed to eliminate decision fatigue and the "pen-pal" paradox of modern dating. Unlike competitors that focus on endless swiping and chatting, HiI'm focuses on getting users offline and into the real world.

The core differentiator is the **"Tap-to-Unlock"** mechanic. Users do not know the date location until they physically meet and tap their phones together. The specific venue is generated by an AI algorithm that balances the **Male User's Budget** with the **Female User's Vibe/Preferences**.

## ⚡ Key Features

  * **🤖 AI Date Concierge:** Removes the "Where should we go?" conversation. The algorithm selects venues based on real-time inputs (Budget constraint + Interest parameters).
  * **📲 NFC "Proof of Life" Unlock:** The venue remains hidden until both devices detect proximity via NFC/Bluetooth tap. This guarantees the date actually occurs and prevents flaking.
  * **👻 Accountability Engine:** A unique monetization model that penalizes "ghosting" and "standing up" matches. Users have a limited strike allowance before monetization gates prevent further matching, incentivizing respectful behavior.
  * **📍 Hyper-Local API:** Integration with maps and venue APIs to ensure the unlocked destination is within walking distance of the meeting point.

## 🔄 User Flow

1.  **Match:** Users match via standard profile parameters.
2.  **Input:**
      * *Male:* Sets the budget cap (e.g., $$-$$$$).
      * *Female:* Sets the date preference (e.g., "Speakeasy," "Active," "Chill").
3.  **The Meet Up:** The app designates a central public meeting point (landmark).
4.  **The Tap:** Upon meeting, users tap phones.
5.  **The Reveal:** The AI instantly reveals the booked venue nearby.
